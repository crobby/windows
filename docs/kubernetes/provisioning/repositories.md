# Repositories

Outside of Rancher's codebase, Rancher maintains several independently released components that Provisioning V2 relies on.

## Rancher Machine

`rancher/machine` is a fork of [docker/machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) that Rancher has been maintaining since the upstream repository has been archived.

`rancher/machine` powers provisioning infrastructure across various cloud providers in both Rancher's Provisioning V1 (RKE) and Provisioning V2 (k3s / RKE2) solutions.

It can be used as an independent binary of its own right; each call to `create` like `rancher-machine create -d <driver> <additional-driver-args> <instance-name>` can be used to provision exactly one node on a given infrastructure provider (identified by `<driver>`), given some configuration arguments for the node (identified within the ` <additional-driver-args>`).

For more information on how it is used, please see the Generic Machine Provider [docs](./generic_machine_provider.md).

## System Agent / Wins

[`rancher/system-agent`](https://github.com/rancher/system-agent) is a daemon that sits on every host provisioned or bootstrapped (i.e. custom clusters) by Provisioning V2.

This daemon is provided a `KUBECONFIG` that allows it to watch a specific Machine Plan Secret within the local / management cluster, through which it retrieves a "Plan" to be executed. 

On initialization, the Machine Plan Secret typically starts with a "one time instruction" that installs the distribution (i.e. k3s or RKE2) using file(s) found in a System Agent Installer image.

For more information, please read the [docs](./system_agent.md)

## Wins

[`rancher/wins`](https://github.com/rancher/wins) embeds System Agent and supports additional functionality on Windows hosts.

For more information, please read the [docs](./wins.md).

## System Agent Installer

Rancher maintains two repositories that are System Agent Installers:

1. [`rancher/system-agent-installer-rke2`](https://github.com/rancher/system-agent-installer-rke2) (supports Windows)

2. [`rancher/system-agent-installer-k3s`](https://github.com/rancher/system-agent-installer-k3s) (does not support Windows)

A System Agent Installer is a Docker image that contains a `run.sh` or `run.ps1` that installs a Kubernetes distribution onto a host.

The run file itself typically just runs the underlying `k3s` or `rke2` installation process the same way that users are instructed to do so to manually provision those clusters in the docs.

System Agent Installer images are typically built from [`scratch`](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) since they are treated as an [**OCI Artifact**](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/oci/what-are-oci-artifacts/); this means that they are only pulled by System Agent to extract the files. Once extracted, the image is never executed since the command is run on the host.

For more information on how this "one-time instruction" is executed within Provisioning V2, see the [System Agent](./system_agent.md) docs.
